# Quarto Examples

In this repo you will find a collection of projects that use Quarto to publish data content. Quarto is a computational notebook system that supports R, Python, Julia, and JavaScript. Quarto is designed to support the publication of data-centric content to the web, PDF, and other formats.

To get started with Quarto, I recommend watching the [Quarto Crash Course](https://youtu.be/_VKxTPWDhA4?si=p5GqH8l8zi2Toog8) video posted on YouTube

## Projects

### Generate Dashboards with Python & Quarto (Airbnb Reviews Analysis)

In this project we have 6 months of Airbnb reviews data for the city of Boston. We create a dashboard that shows trends over time, where our airbnb properties are, and interactive tables of listings & review data. Check out the video [here](https://example.com).

### Generate HTML Reports (Telecom Churn Analysis)

<img src='https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be3bd861-8935-49c6-956d-89bee0dcd968' width=40%/>

In this project we have a dataset of telecom customers and their churn status. We use Quarto to generate an HTML report that includes code, output, and narrative. This report is designed to be shared with a non-technical audience.

One key feature of this video is that we will quickly convert a Jupyter Notebook into the HTML report. This is a common workflow for many data scientists who are looking to share their work with a broader audience.

### Slideshows in Quarto

In this video we dive deeper into the slideshow capabilities of Quarto with Python. We adapt the demo slideshow from Quarto documentation to focus on Python based code snippets.
